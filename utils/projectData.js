      "Plailister is a dashboard type of website I developed for a music label 'Place Called Home'. The label developed data analytics tools to manage their playlists, artists, marketing campaings, and many more. \nPlailister was developed using React in Next.JS, deployed on Vercel. MUI was used to build the many components. \nA requested feature was to implement a dark & light mode, se;ected by the user. The main challenge of this project was performance, the team had many complicated algorithms to analyze theiur millions of data, and the website needed to be user-friendly, and fast, managing the data in the best way possible was everyday's job, and the team is happy with it.",
